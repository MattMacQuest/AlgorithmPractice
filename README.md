# Algorithm Practice Space
This repo is designed solely as a "playground" of sorts to test self-implementations of various algorithms as a means to gain a deeper understanding of how they work and to test various ways to make them more/less efficient. I also plan to just use it a general testing ground for various coding concepts

## Current Task:
- Implement more sorting algorithms

## To Do:
- Implement configuration files using YAML
- Implement sorting algorithms
    - Bubble Sort
    - Insertion Sort
    - Quick Sort
- ~~Add menu system~~
    - Load menu items from config files dynamically
    - Change config from the menu
- Improve documentation
- Add more robust benchmarking capabilities
    - Add memory benchmarking
- Add support for multiple test types
- Add support for data structures and related tests

## Ideas
- ~~Creating an "Application" class that holds things like settings, generated list~~
    - Maybe add a history of performance metrics as well
    - Could include the functionality of the ConfigManager class
